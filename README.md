## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play

2. You click any first card and it will show you a specific picture.

3. Click another card it will show you picture. If the pictue on second card  matches with the previous one then it is a match and will stay in show state.

4. Keep playing till you have matched all the cards on the board.

5. You get maximumof 3 stars if you finish the game in under 20 moves.
